# Introduction

Welcome to the [Tagplay](https://tagplay.co) API! You can use our API to programmatically access the Tagplay product.

With Tagplay, you can post your content on social media to update your website automatically.

Update your content with Facebook Pages & Profiles, Instagram, Twitter and email.
You can also use any social media management or content management tools of your choice.
We redirect your content when it shares to social media.

You can use a certain **#tag** from one of your social media profiles to control which content goes
where on your website.
